# Zip-It

Dear Humans

The aim of this practical session is to 'Hack the Zipper'. The global Fashion Industry is the 2nd most polluting industry in the world which relies heavily on the exploitation of mostly women all-over the word. One of the biggest challenge in emerging Fashion sectors in developing countries are inputs for manufacturing such as zippers, buttons and buckles, etc. Therefore, this session challenges the issues surrounding the zipper by experimenting and customising of Rapid Prototyping Technologies. Participants will get the opportunity to challenge, experiment and hack the Future of the Zipper. They can create prototypes that are innovative, tech-related, extraordinary or just geeky and funny.
